            My name is Priyana! I'm a second-year HCDE Master's student with a background in Cognitive Science and Digital Humanities. I am taking this course to familiarize myself with up-and-coming manufacturing tools in the industry. I am excited to learn how to utilize physical fabrication tools and software to strengthen my knowledge of building physical and digital prototypes. As a recent Data Science for Social Good Fellow, I hope to teach my peers how to produce robust documentation on Github to increase the accessibility of their work.
