<h4>Assembly and Setup</h4>
I assembled my printer slowly over three days following this helpful tutorial <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibsOYzXduYc"> online </a>. Surprisingly, I had no major issues apart from putting some parts on the wrong way and re-tightening some bolts. I adjusted the extruder's eccentric nuts at the end so it glided without wiggling. I also adjusted the build plate level and checked for loose screws.

<h4>Bed Leveling Protocol</h4>
My main challenge throughout the entire assignment came from the bed leveling protocol. Initially, I had adhesion issues because my extruder was too far from my build plate. After adjusting each corner, my extruder was too close to the build plate and scratched the surface. Each time I adjusted, the top left corner of my plate seemed to be too close to the extruder despite winding the knob all the way to the end. I then adjusted the eccentric nuts under the plate to re-level my plate. This did the trick, and I could finally run the print with my filament sticking to the plate. Unfortunately, I had to waste a lot of filament to complete this procedure.

<h4>Test Prints: Cubes</h4>
I created all of my prints in Rhino, exported them as .stl files, selected the specific settings, and sliced them in Cura.
</br>

<h5>"Low Quality" Cube</h5>
My first cube went relatively well except for some "lifting" on the bottom right corner. After printing, I adjusted this plate area to compensate for the adhesion issues. For this print, I used the skirt build plate settings. The final cube measured 1.99 cm by 2.00 cm with calipers. </br>

</br>

<h5>"Standard Quality" Cube</h5>
My second cube looked about the same as my first cube with the lifting on the bottom right corner despite adjusting the plate. For this print, I also used the skirt plate setting but had some difficulty removing the cube from the plate. The final cube measured 1.98 cm by 1.98 cm. </br>

</br>
	
<h5>"Super Quality" Cube</h5>
For my super quality cube, I used the brim build plate setting. This appeared to help level the base of my cube, creating a much cleaner and more level cube. However, I could not remove my cube from the plate and had to soak it in ice-cold water (with my cube). After letting it sit for a while, I could finally take it off with my spatula. The final cube measured 1.98 cm by 1.98 cm. </br>

</br>

<h5>Concentric Cube</h5>
I printed my concentric cube with the super quality print settings. After cycling through the other build plate settings, I decided to try the raft. This worked extremely well, and I could easily detach my cube from the plate and support. My cube looked clean, with some slight residue from the raft. The final cube measured 1.99 cm by 1.99 cm. </br>

<h4>Tubes</h4> 

<h5>Single Extrusion Tube</h5>
Although fragile, I managed to print my single extrusion tube in one try. The edges appeared a bit jagged, but this may have been an export issue from Rhino. To preserve the curves in Cura, I exported with a 0.01 cm tolerance. The final tube measured 2.99 cm by 3.01 cm. </br>

</br>

<h5>Double Extrusion + Random Z-Seam Alignment Tube</h5>
My second tube came out much stronger thanks to the double extrusion wall. While it came out clean on the top and the bottom, there were a lot of random specks on the side of my tube. This surprisingly only happened with this print. The final tube measured 3.00 cm by 3.06 cm. </br>

</br>
</br>

<h4>Cylinders</h4> 

<h5>0.1mm Tolerance Cylinder</h5>
My first cylinder came out clean on the top, but the sides were also jagged like my tubes. There was also some leftover residue from my raft build plate. The final cylinder measured 2.99 cm by 2.95 cm. </br>

</br>

<h5>0.001mm Tolerance Cylinder</h5>
This was the only cylinder that came out clean and smooth with no jagged edges. There was, however, some leftover residue on the bottom. The final cylinder measured 3.03 cm by 2.97 cm, despite applying the more precise tolerance. </br>

</br>

<h5>"Spiralize Outer Contour" Cylinder</h5>
This cylinder came out with no top, some leftover residue from the build plate, and was very thin (much like the tubes). The final cylinder measured 3.03 cm by 2.94 cm. </br>

</br>

<h5>Side + Supports Cylinder</h5>
My final cylinder came out relatively clean but had a lot of excess filament where the supports were. There was also a side where the cylinder appeared to sink in a bit, which may be due to the supports. The cylinder measured cm 2.98 cm by 2.97 cm.

<h4>Nested Object</h4>
I took inspiration from the nested rainbow children's toy for my nested object. I created my small inner arch in Rhino and added a line at the bottom. I then created two additional arcs composed of two half circles joined with two lines at the bottom of each end. I then extruded the three objects to 3 cm in height, and each arc was 1 cm apart from the other. I scaled my structures to 500% (instead of 1000% like my other prints) to convert to mm in Cura to save time. I kept all of the default print settings the same and sliced under standard quality.
