<h4>Assembly and Setup</h4>
I assembled my printer slowly over three days following this helpful tutorial online (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibsOYzXduYc). Surprisingly, I had no major issues apart from putting some parts on the wrong way and re-tightening some bolts. I adjusted the extruder's eccentric nuts at the end so it glided without wiggling. I also adjusted the build plate level and checked for loose screws.

<h4>Bed Leveling Protocol</h4>
My main challenge throughout the entire assignment came from the bed leveling protocol. Initially, I had adhesion issues because my extruder was too far from my build plate. After adjusting each corner, my extruder was too close to the build plate and scratched the surface. Each time I adjusted, the top left corner of my plate seemed to be too close to the extruder despite winding the knob all the way to the end. I then adjusted the eccentric nuts under the plate to re-level my plate. This did the trick, and I could finally run the print with my filament sticking to the plate. Unfortunately, I had to waste a lot of filament to complete this procedure.

<h4>Test Prints: Cubes</h4>
I created all of my prints in Rhino, exported them as .stl files, selected the specific settings, and sliced them in Cura.

| "Low Quality" Cube  | Second Header |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| My first cube went relatively well except for some "lifting" on the bottom right corner. After printing, I adjusted this plate area to compensate for the adhesion issues. For this print, I used the skirt build plate settings. The final cube measured 1.99 cm by 2.00 cm with calipers.  | Content Cell  |

Nested Object
I took inspiration from the nested rainbow children's toy for my nested object. I created my small inner arch in Rhino and added a line at the bottom. I then created two additional arcs composed of two half circles joined with two lines at the bottom of each end. I then extruded the three objects to 3 cm in height, and each arc was 1 cm apart from the other. I scaled my structures to 500% (instead of 1000% like my other prints) to convert to mm in Cura to save time. I kept all of the default print settings the same and sliced under standard quality.
