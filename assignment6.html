<h4>Finishing up the Lamp</h4>
Last week, I had created my base mesh for my lamp and was experimenting with different shade patterns. This week, I fabricated and iterated several versions of my lamp stand to fit my bulb and lamp innards. I also utilized Grasshopper to achieve the spiralized and ridged pattern for my shade. 

<h3>Stand</h3>
After first printing my stand, I found that the opening was too tight, which didnâ€™t allow the pendant to sit balanced. After using Scale2D to make the diameter bigger by 2 mm, I found that the bulb sat too low this time, causing the bottom of the lamp innards to hit the ground. In this case, the lamp and stand were both unstable. I scaled the diameter back down by 1 mm which was the perfect fit.
