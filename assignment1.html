            I first explored different geometric shapes on Noun Project to use for my construction kit. I picked out shapes and vectors that varied from sharp to round edges. Once I had my shapes, I experimented with the slot lengths and widths in Adobe Illustrator. Based on some feedback from my classmates, I made the slots for two of my shapes 2 mm wide (1 mm less than my cardboard) and 1/8 the width of the entire shape. I then decided to do a test cut with my three shapes to see how they would fit together.     </br>

            Based on the laser cutting machine instructions at the 8, I adjusted the stroke in my .ai file to 0.01. I then transferred it to a flash drive and connected it to the laser cutter. I changed the materials settings to "mat board" and set the thickness to 2 mm (also 1 mm less than my cardboard thickness).

            After playing around with my three shapes, I decided to go with my third shape which I would describe as a combination of a rectangle, diamond, and parallelogram. I personally liked that it didn't contain all equal sides and thought it would give me more freedom when putting them together. Comfortable with the previous settings and slot thickness, I duplicated my shapes in my .ai file and went back to cutting. 
                
            Once I had all my pieces cut, I put my model together. While I had some difficulty adjusting the orientation and direction I wanted to build my model, I finally ended up with a three-tiered structure with alternating pieces fitting together at different angles and slots. The final model is composed of 33 cardboard pieces.
