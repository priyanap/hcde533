<h4>Modifying STLs</h4>
I decided to start off small by experimenting and combining my meshes. I downloaded a ring and diamond file from Thingiverse (files linked and designers credited below). I opened the ring file in Rhino and rotated it so that it was standing upright on one of the flat edges. I then imported my diamond and placed it on the top of the ring in the center. I then brought it down a bit so that the two objects overlap. I did this to combine my mesh files but also so that the diamond would print firmly in place. I then used the MeshBooleanUnion command to combine my meshes. This function combined the objects into one, removing any overlap between the ring and the diamond. Because the files were already closed polysurfaces, I successfully exported the single structure as an STL file without additional repairs to the mesh. </br>

After this, I used the BooleanUnion function to join the boxes and alternate joints. After connecting each panel with the joints, I hid the objects to make it easier to see which ones I had already connected. Once I joined all the sides, I rotated each panel and used Make2D to flatten the boards. I opened a new Rhino file and extruded the three sides back to 0.125 inches (one bottom and two adjoining sides) to see whether my pieces would fit.
