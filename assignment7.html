<h3>Inspo</h3>
For my final project, I am going to make a bamboo shoulder bag. My inspiration comes from the brand Cult Gaia which has several “cage” Ark bags. The silhouette is a half circle but there have also been a few “box” variations. As a big fan of (at least admiring) designer bags, I thought it would be cool to try to recreate or do a spinoff of this unique bag.</br>

<h3>Concept Sketch</h3>
After modeling the bag in Rhino, I plan on laser cutting the main pieces of the bag and connecting them using press fit joints. The top side piece on each side of the bag will have an opening for a 3d printed anchor clip. This clip will connect the bag to the purse chain, which I will also 3D print. For the sake of time and also for a smaller accessory for shorter outings, I plan on making my bag the same dimensions as the nano belt bag (6”W x 2”D x 5.75”H).
